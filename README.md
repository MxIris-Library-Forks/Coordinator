# Coordinator

Implementation of _Coordinator_ design pattern. It is *the* application architecture pattern for iOS, carefully designed to fit into UIKit; so much it could easily be `UICoordinator`.

Since this is *core architectural pattern*, it‚Äôs not possible to explain its usage with one or two clever lines of code. Give it a day or two; analyze and play around. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôll find it worthy of your time and future projects.

## Installation

- version 7.x and up is made with Swift 5.5 concurrency in mind (async / awai)
- versions before that (6.x) use closures

### Manually 

Just drag `Coordinator` folder into your project ‚Äî it‚Äòs only a handful of files.

If you prefer to use dependency managers, see below. 
Releases are tagged with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) in mind.

### Swift Package Manager 

Ready, just add this repo URL as Package. 

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Coordinator into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Coordinator', 	:git => 'https://github.com/radianttap/Coordinator.git'
```

### Setting up with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Coordinator into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "radianttap/Coordinator"
```
